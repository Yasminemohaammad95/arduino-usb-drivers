# Instructions

Here I have the signed drivers for the CH341 and CH340 usb controller drivers. These drivers are commonly found on Chinese Arduino micro-controllers. 

This repo contains the drivers for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. Just download the repo and follow the instructions in the ReadMe files in each folder. If you have a previously installed a version of these usb drivers, you will likely need to uninstall them before installing the new ones.
