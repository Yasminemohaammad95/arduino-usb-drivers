# Instructions

The CH341 and CH340 USB controllers are commonly found on Chinese Arduinos microcontrollers and to use them with the Arduino IDE or CLI you need to install 3rd party drivers.

This repo contains the drivers for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Just download the repo and follow the instructions in the README files in each folder. If you have a previously installed a version of these USB drivers, you will likely need to uninstall them before installing the new ones.
