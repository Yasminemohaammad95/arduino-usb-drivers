# Instructions

Here I have the signed drivers for the CH341 and CH340 USB controller drivers. These drivers are commonly found on Chinese Arduinos microcontrollers. 

This repo contains the drivers for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Just download the repo and follow the instructions in the README files in each folder. If you have a previously installed a version of these USB drivers, you will likely need to uninstall them before installing the new ones.
